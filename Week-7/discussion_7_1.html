<p>Angular gives developers two strategies when it comes to building forms in our applications, template-driven and reactive. The level of complexity required by your application will govern which form strategy you use for your forms.</p>
<p>Template-driven forms are view model based, that allow the use of the ng-model's two-way binding. "Forms built with this directive can only be tested in an end to end test because this requires the presence of a DOM, but still, this mechanism is very useful and simple to understand. (Contact@angular-Academy.io, 2019)"</p>
<p>Reactive forms uses a model based data structure. This allows the application to store and track data changes for the life of the form. "On the surface there is already a big gain: We can now unit test the form validation logic. (Contact@angular-Academy.io, 2019)"</p>
<p>"Reactive forms are more robust. They're more scalable, reusable, and testable. If forms are a key part of your application, or you're already using reactive patterns for building your application, use reactive forms. (Angular.io)" With more built in features, reactive form elements gives the developers more tools to build more complex forms and interactions.</p>
<p>"Template-driven forms are useful for adding a simple form to an app, such as an email list signup form. They're easy to add to an app, but they don't scale as well as reactive forms. If you have very basic form requirements and logic that can be managed solely in the template, use template-driven forms. (Angular.io)" Template-driven form elements allows developers a way to build quick powerful forms with less work. Making the building of the forms a more simple process.</p>
<p>No matter which strategy a developer chooses to use, Angular's powerful framework has the ability to meet the use case.</p>
